while I'm a student for 1 year, I don't know how to start learning about programming, but I should hard work bro. and I am not very smart in English both written or spoken. but in the past 3 years ago, I just keep do it. I trying to write a code starting from HTML, CSS, and basic javascript.

in university, I'm taking a bachelor's degree for my background. at the campus, I learn much more about programming languages suck as like c++, basic, PHP, java, bash, assembly, and python. and also learn architecture programs like MVC or model view controller with OOP object Oriented.

in the past 1.5 years, I still get not my journey for software engineering, but, I actively joined an event scholarship from dicoding academy to learn and get a certificate for basic android, basic web applications, and others until now. not only dicoding academy I also active self-taught learning from the internet and another platform for keeping up to date and improve my skill, like watch youtube, buy e-course from udemy

### how much spend is your time learning programming?

I'm Learning programming is like you can call "NOLIFE", while I'm still a student in 2017 and get first Internship work, I kept learning programming everyday start from morning to midnight, and while the internship I learn on Saturday, Sunday I'm not learning I just sleep for one day because I'm very tired. sometimes learning code is boring.

### where you get resource for learning ?

actually, I'm getting free resources from the internet, you can get free by googling. I'm starting from w3school for general programming languages, javascript info, MDN Mozilla for learning about javascript, and youtube for learning about demos of how to program its work. and also buy some books in "Indonesia & English languages" for improve knowledge. I join at programming group at telegram to get more information about what technology is used in the market and discuss the problem

### what your project in first time ?

my first project is a website static with native HTML, CSS, and javascript, if I look back it's very ugly hahaha. I'm interested in the front end because I think to make design is easier event to be a backend and implement an algorithm. but for now, I have chosen the both, beautiful UI is important for user experience, and the backend is also important for services, without the backend apps can't run dynamic

### after 3 years ?

okay, what a get is not much because technology is very fast growing up when I'm internship for 3 months I learned my first framework PHP is code igniter 3 and I'm to be a full-stack web developer for handle native company profile with PHP 7. after 3 months a get hired, but you know, the tech upgrades I've not used code igniter again, I should to know laravel 7 for one month hahaha. I learned laravel basic crud for one week, I have little understanding about that. but my company has exciting apps with that's. "difference programmer has difference type writing a code" and I don't know what they write hahaha. I need 2 - 3 months to understand they write a code and flow program

finally, i keep do it until now learn full-stack laravel 8 and frontend with Vue Js 3, and also i open to learn new technology like node js with express or java with spring boot
