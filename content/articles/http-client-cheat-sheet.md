### HTTP Methods Status Codes

#### successfull

| HTTP code | message    | description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200       | OK         | In the response to successful GET, PATCH or DELETE.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 201       | Created    | In the response to POST that results in creation. When this status is received, the request body contains the description of the newly created entity in the JSON format (similar to the regular GET request). |
| 204       | No Content | In the response to a successful request that wonâ€™t return a body (like a DELETE request)                                                                                                                       |

| --------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400       | Bad Request           | The request is malformed, such as if the body of the request contains misformatted JSON.                                                        |
| 401       | Unauthorized          | No or invalid authentication details are provided. This code can be used to trigger an authentication pop-up if the API is used from a browser. |
| 403       | Forbidden             | Authentication succeeded but authenticated user does not have access to the resource.                                                           |
| 404       | Not Found             | A non-existent resource is requested.                                                                                                           |

#### example error message schema

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "404",
      "title": "not found http exception",
      "detail": "An entity with the requested identifier does not exist."
    }
  ]
}
```

#### example body response message schema

```json
{
   "date" : "Date: Mon, 19 Sep 2016 17:52:34 GMT",
   "description" : "get all data from xyz",
   "status" : 200,
   "data": {
      "type": "users",
      "id": "1",
      "attributes": {
         "title": null,
         "email": "admin@local.com",
         "firstName": "John",
         "enabled": true,
         "lastLogin": "2016-09-19T11:01:31Z",
      },
      "relationships": {
         "owner": {
            "data":
            {
               "type": "businessunits",
                "id": "1"
                }
            },
         "businessUnits": {
            "data": [
               {
                  "type": "businessunits",
                   "id": "1"
                   }
               ]
            },
      }
}

```

if you used http client from vscode extention and file file like rest.http
you can send request without POSTMAN

# REST CLIENT

### Header

example send request header

```
POST https://example.com/v1/comments HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json
User-Agent: rest-client
Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.6,zh-CN;q=0.4
```

### Body

```
{
    "name": "sample",
    "time": "Wed, 21 Oct 2015 18:27:50 GMT"
}
```

### Combine Header and Request

_POST_

```http

## Example Laravel for rest

here is example controller for laravel making api, it's very very basic. it's not recommend but it's can be reference for basic makes restfull api

### controller

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Model\Posts;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

class PostController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {

        try {
            $blog = new Posts;
            $response = [
                "message" => "blog post",
                "status" => 200,
                "data" => $blog->all()
            ];
            return response()->json($response, Response::HTTP_OK);
        } catch (\Throwable $th) {
            $response = [
                "message" => "blog post not found",
                "status" => 404,

            return response()->json($response, Response::HTTP_NOT_FOUND);
        }
    }
}


```

### route

here is example api route for laravel making api, it's very very basic. it's not recommend but it's can be reference for basic makes restfull api

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

// http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/posts/filter?page=5&size=10
Route::get('/v1/posts/query', [
    'as' => 'post.query',
    'uses' => 'PostController@show'
]);

Route::post('/v1/posts/search', [
    'as' => 'post.search',
    'uses' => 'PostController@search'
]);

Route::get('/v1/posts/all', [
    'as' => 'post.all',
    'uses' => 'PostController@index'
]);

Route::post('/v1/posts/store', [
