# Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

client side rendering became popular after javascript framework like Angular, React, or Vue.js. This process means that the initial load is prolonged. after load time, the websites' navigation will be super smooth and super fast, only having to make API calls to get the content dynamically. A great use case of client0side rendering is a single-page application (SPA). in a SPA, each page is rendered on the client broser. The server only servers on single HTML document.

# Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

SSR is one of them commonly used rendering solutions. it is pretty much the opposite of the layer client-side rendering.
unlike client side rendering, every subsequent time the user takes action to visit a different page, the rendering process repeats. the server will serve the page request to the server for every new page, and each request.

# static site generation (SSG)

basically, a static site geenration is a program or a tool used to generate static HTML website and pages based on raw data and templates. static site generator atomates the process of having to code HTML pages manually.
